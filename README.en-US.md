## Quick Start

### Frontend

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm i

# Start service
pnpm run start
```

### Backend

For local development, it is recommended to set up your own ruoyi server for API integration.
If you just want to try it out, the project is pre-configured to connect to my test server, no extra setup needed.

## Project Structure

This project uses turborepo to manage a monorepo, with a clear structure for easy extension and maintenance:

-   `apps/`: Main app directory, all frontend projects (e.g. admin-antd, admin-shadcn-nextjs) are here.
-   `packages/`: Shared libraries and tools, including dev-server, UI library, eslint/ts config, docs, etc.
-   `frontend/`: Frontend-related code. If backend is added in the future, a `backend/` directory will be created.
-   `_assets/`: Images and assets for documentation.

### Local Development

1. Install dependencies (in project root):
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
2. Start a frontend project (e.g. admin-antd):
    ```bash
    pnpm --filter admin-antd dev
    ```
    Or enter `apps/admin-antd` and run:
    ```bash
    pnpm run dev
    ```
3. For other apps or packages, see their respective README files.
